## Under Investigation

- [OpenCut](https://github.com/OpenCut-app/OpenCut) - Over 17,000 stars in a short period of time with no mentions found of the software on major socials. Oddly there is not a single screenshot anywhere. Their main website seems to be opencut.app but another website was found, opencut.io, that has downloads links, no screenshots, and a GitHub icon that points to the same repo.
