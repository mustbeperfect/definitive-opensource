  <summary><b>Stars aren't a good metric to guage popularity/quality.</b></summary> <br />
The minimum star count of 1k has been a major point of contention. Admittedly, star counts don't always reflect project popularity and quality. Stars are biased towards developers because they are the ones with a GitHub account, thus leaving out the input of the end users. But no solution is going to be a one size fits all solution. It's critically important that as the list scales it doesn't devolve into a clutter trap, even if the price is some projects getting left out.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Stars tend to be synonomous with community recognition, making it a good starting point for further vetting to check for contributors, future plans, and popularity. Most compotent software will have no trouble reaching the 1k star count. This requirement is also just the first step for further vetting.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Artificial star counts (EX: buying stars) has also been brought up. This isn't that big of a problem, again, stars are just to quality a project for further vetting. We check community engagement, developer responsiveness and the project's statistics over time. A popular project should have lots of community activity, GitHub issues, pr's, etc. Evidence of foul play will disquality a project.
